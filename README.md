# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub

I'm Celso, a Computer Engineer and Data Science Specialist with a passion for AI, Machine Learning, and C/Java/R/Python development.

## About this GitHub

This space serves as both a professional portfolio and an educational hub for developers and data enthusiasts.  
Here youâ€™ll find a mix of:

- **Educational Java projects** for students and beginners
- **Research projects**: including my thesis on Nonlinear Multilevel Modeling simulating Neural Networks
- **AI and LLM experiments** in Java and Python
- **Quantum Machine Learning studies** integrating classical and quantum approaches
- **Data analysis and ML projects** using Python, R, and Java ML libraries
- **And more** ...

## Upcoming Projects

Iâ€™m currently working on:
- **Agents based on LLMs** written in Java and Python
- **Deep Learning models**, for hierarchical data too
- **Machine Lerning models**, including hierarchical models
- **Java, C, R, Python and Rust** projects
- Integrating statistical modeling principles into Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects.

## About Private Projects

In addition to the public repositories you see here, I also maintain several private projects â€” including capstone projects, academic research, my thesis, and experimental developments.

While these are not publicly available, feel free to explore my public repos to get a sense of my coding style, interests, and the areas I'm currently working on.

## Letâ€™s connect

If youâ€™re interested in collaborating, learning, or just having a good conversation about AI, ML, Java, or tech in general â€” feel free to reach out.
