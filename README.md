## About Private Projects

In addition to the public repositories you see here, I also maintain several private projects — including capstone projects, academic research, my thesis, and experimental developments.

While these are not publicly available, feel free to explore my public repos to get a sense of my coding style, interests, and the areas I'm currently working on.

## Let’s connect

If you’re interested in collaborating, learning, or just having a good conversation about AI, ML, Java, or tech in general — feel free to reach out.
